This repository contains a simple PHP function that demonstrates an infinite recursion bug. The function `foo` recursively adds the second argument `b` to itself `a` times.  The bug occurs when the first argument `a` is a negative number, causing the function to call itself indefinitely, leading to a stack overflow error. The solution demonstrates how to handle this using input validation.
